title: What is Low-Ops ?
---

Low-Ops is an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) designed specifically for private cloud and on-premise deployments. It
transforms your existing infrastructure into a secure, powerful platform for Mendix app development and deployment, all
within your controlled environment.

### Internal Developer Platform

Low-Ops is a internal developer platform for running applications in a cloud environment. It is designed to be easy to
use and to require minimal maintenance. At its core, it is a Kubernetes cluster with a set of tools to make it easy to
deploy and manage applications. It is designed to be used by developers and operators with minimal knowledge of
Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure. You will be able to do all your tasks through the Low-Ops Portal supported with
best practices of delivering applications to your business and customers.

### Focus on value delivery. Not re-inventing the wheel.

Without Low-Ops, an organization would need to hire a team of DevOps, Cloud engineers and Platform engineers to build
and maintain a platform for running applications. This is a costly and time-consuming process. Low-Ops solves this
problem by providing a platform that is easy to use and requires minimal maintenance. This allows organizations to focus
on their core business and deliver value to their customers.

### Philosophy

Deploying components onto Kubernetes is not rocket science. However, having the platform to be reproducible, scalable,
and maintainable is a challenge. Low-Ops is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal maintenance. It is designed
to be used by developers and operators with minimal knowledge of Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure. You will be able
to do all your tasks through the Low-Ops Portal supported with best practices of delivering applications to your
business and customers.

Because the whole platform is fully automated and runs on your infrastructure, you have 100% control over your data and
can be sure that it is secure. You can also easily integrate it with your existing systems and processes.

Don't want or need upgradability of Low-Ops? You can modify it to fit your needs. You can also use it as a starting
point for your own platform.
