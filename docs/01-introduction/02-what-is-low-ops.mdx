### Internal Developer Platform (IDP)

Low-Ops is a internal developer platform for running applications in a cloud environment. It is designed to be easy to
use and to require minimal maintenance. At its core, it is a Kubernetes cluster with a set of tools to make it easy to
deploy and manage applications. It is designed to be used by developers and operators with minimal knowledge of
Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure. You will be able to do all your tasks through the Low-Ops Portal supported with
best practices of delivering applications to your business and customers.

### Focus on value delivery. Not re-inventing the wheel.

Without Low-Ops, an organization would need to hire a team of DevOps, Cloud engineers and Platform engineers to build
and maintain a platform for running applications. This is a costly and time-consuming process. Low-Ops solves this
problem by providing a platform that is easy to use and requires minimal maintenance. This allows organizations to focus
on their core business and deliver value to their customers.
