title: Single Node Installation
---

The single node version of the Low-Ops platform allows you to run Low-Ops on a single Linux machine, making it ideal for
testing purposes.

:::warning

The single node version of the Low-Ops platform is not recommended for production environments.

:::

:::info Prerequisites

The minimum system resources required to run the single node version of the Low-Ops platform are:

- 16 GB RAM
- 8-core CPU
- 500 GB Disk

:::

### Foundation

This setup requires a single Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) server with internet access. DNS resolution is required for the
platform to work. Create a DNS record for the platform base domain.

### Installation

To start Platform installation process make sure you have ssh access to the server with sudo privileges. During platform
installation all OCI images will be pulled from the docker hub public repositories. But the image pull limit could be
reached. To avoid this issue you have to set docker registry credentials, you can request temporary credentials from the
Low-Ops team.

`From your VM terminal, run the following command to start the installation:`

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cinaq/helm-charts/refs/heads/main/charts/lowops-platform/scripts/install-platform.sh
  && chmod +x install-platform.sh
  && ./install-platform.sh

```

You will be asked to provide the following information:

- Platform base domain (must be resolvable from the internet to your server public IP address)
- Docker registry credentials
- Platform admin credentials

After installation is complete, you can access the platform portal UI at `https://portal.your.domain.com`
