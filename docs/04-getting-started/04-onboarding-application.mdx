Low-Ops supports onboarding applications using either predefined templates or your own custom templates.

You can onboard applications from two locations:

1. `Applications` on the home screen
2. `Admin Applications` in the Admin section

## Onboarding an Application

### <span style={{ fontSize: "1.2rem" }}>**Step 1.** Choose a Template</span>

Select from predefined templates or upload your own custom custom template.

### <span style={{ fontSize: "1.2rem" }}>**Step 2.** Name Your Application</span>

<img src="/img/create-app-2.png" alt="Create Application" className="image" />

Give your application a unique name. This name cannot be changed later. Add a description to help identify its purpose.

### <span style={{ fontSize: "1.2rem" }}>**Step 3.** Create and Wait</span>

Click `Create` to start the process. A loading indicator will show while your application is being created. Once
complete, you'll have access to your new application.
