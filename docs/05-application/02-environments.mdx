title: Environments

Environments represent different stages of application deployment, such as `development`, `testing`, `staging`, and
`production`. Each environment has its own set of configurations, resources, and permissions. Environments provide you
with an isolated instance of all services in a project.

In Low-Ops, you can easily create and manage environments for every stage of your application, ensuring smooth
deployment and seamless operations.

### Accessing Environments

To access the Environments page, navigate to the `Application > Environments` tab in Low-Ops.
