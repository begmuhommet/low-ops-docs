Environments represent different stages of application deployment, such as `development`, `testing`, `staging`, and
`production`. Each environment has its own set of configurations, resources, and permissions. Environments give you an
isolated instance of all services in a project.

In a Low-Ops, you can easily create and manage environments for every stage of your application, ensuring smooth
deployment and seamless operations.

### Accessing Environments
