Packages allow you to view and manage build versions, providing insight into your application's development history and
enabling you to track changes over time.

Packages are created automatically when you push a new commit to the repository. All packages are available for every
environment.

### View Packages

To view packages, navigate to the `Application > Packages` tab in Low-Ops.

### Package Vulnerabilities

The Vulnerabilities feature helps identify and categorize potential `security issues` within each `package/build`,
allowing you to address vulnerabilities promptly.

:::note

Regularly reviewing Vulnerabilities information can help maintain the `security` of your applications and address
potential issues in a timely manner.

:::

You can see the Vulnerabilities summary in the Packages screen under the `job` column. You can also navigate to the
package details `Application > Package > Vulnerabilities` screen to see full details of the vulnerabilities.

### Package Best Practices

Best practices are a set of `pre-defined rules` that validate app development against `best practices`. They help ensure
code `quality` and `adherence` to development standards.

:::note

Consistently reviewing and addressing both Security Severity issues and Policy test results can significantly enhance
the quality and security of your applications.

:::

You can see the Best Practices summary in the Packages screen under the `job` column. You can also navigate to the
package details `Application > Package > Best Practices` screen to see full details of the best practices.

Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software application are tested in
isolation to verify their correctness.

You can see the Unit Testing summary in the Packages screen under the `job` column. You can also navigate to the package
details `Application > Package > Unit Testing` screen to see full details of the unit testing.
