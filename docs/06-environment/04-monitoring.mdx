Monitoring is essential for proactively identifying and addressing system `issues`, ensuring `performance`, and
maintaining overall `reliability` with minimal manual intervention.

In Low-Ops each `environment` is monitored separately and you can access the monitoring by navigating to
`Application > Environment > Monitoring`. Select the period for which to display the metrics, default is last `3 hours`.
