Logs display application logs for the selected environment. You can access the logs by navigating to
`Application > Environment > Logs`. Logs are refresh every `10 seconds`, so you can see the latest logs.

### Mendix Log Levels

Low-Ops allows you to configure Mendix log levels for each environment.

In the logs screen, click the `Configure Log Levels` button to configure the log levels.

You can add, edit or delete log levels. Log levels have a predefined `log node`, `level` and `description` (optional).
