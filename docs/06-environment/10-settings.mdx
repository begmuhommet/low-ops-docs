The environment settings are used to configure environment specific settings like domain, scaling, and delete
environment.

You can access the environment settings by navigating to `Application > Environment > Settings`.

### Domain Settings

The domain settings are used to configure the domain for the environment. Environment url is generated with
`[app name]-[environment name].[domain]`. If you want to add your own url, you can edit the url field. Also you can
provide `TLS Certificate` and `TLS Certificate Key` to enable TLS for your environment.
