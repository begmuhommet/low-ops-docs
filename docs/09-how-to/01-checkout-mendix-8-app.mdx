# Checkout Mendix 8 App

## **Mendix 8 Support**

Low-Ops platform utilizes private Git repositories to store Mendix application
source code.

Mendix Studio Pro versions before 9 are compatible only with SVN (Version
Control System) and do not support Git. Consequently, Git command line interface
is employed for committing and pushing changes to remote repositories.

#### **Follow steps below to push your changes to the remote repository**

1. Download and install Git-Bash.
2. Use Git-Bash to clone the Mendix project repository.
